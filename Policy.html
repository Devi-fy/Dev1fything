       <p>Privacy Policy for Dev1fy<br>
        <br>
        At Dev1fy, we value the privacy of our users and are committed to protecting their personal information in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This privacy policy outlines the types of personal information we collect, how we use that information, and the steps we take to safeguard it.<br>
        <br>
        Information We Collect<br>
        <br>
        We may collect the following types of personal information from our users:<br>
        <br>
        
        Information provided voluntarily: We may collect information that users provide to us voluntarily when they sign up for a service, such as their name, email address, and other contact information.<br>
        Information collected automatically: We may also collect certain information automatically when users access our website, such as their IP address, browser type, and device information.<br>
        <br>
        How We Use Your Information<br>
        <br>
        We use the personal information we collect to:<br>
        <br>
        
        Provide and improve our services: We may use the information to provide users with our services, and to improve and optimize our website and user experience.<br>
        Communicate with users: We may use the information to communicate with users about their accounts, updates to our services, and other important information.<br>
        Personalize user experience: We may use the information to personalize the content and advertising displayed on our website based on users' preferences and browsing behavior.<br>
        <br>
        Sharing Your Information<br>
        <br>
        We do not share users' personal information with third-party advertisers or partners without their consent. However, we may share 
        users' information with service providers that help us to operate and improve our website, such as hosting providers, analytics providers, and customer support providers. These service providers are contractually bound to keep users' personal information confidential and secure.<br>
        <br>
        Data Retention<br>
        <br>
        We retain users' personal information only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, unless a longer retention period is required by law. When we no longer need to retain users' personal information, we will securely delete or destroy it.<br>
        <br>
        Security Measures<br>
        <br>
        We take appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect users' personal information from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. However, no data transmission or storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot guarantee the security of users' personal information.<br>
        <br>
        User Rights<br>
        <br>
        Users have certain rights with respect to their personal information, including the right to access, correct, and delete their personal information. Users may also have the right to object to certain uses of their personal information, or to request that we provide their personal information to them in a portable format. To exercise these rights, users may contact us using the information provided below.<br>
